Have you ever wanted to mark lines or groups of lines in a way that is easy to see and be be able to jump to those markings? The WholeLineColor plugin lets you do just that. Using Vim's signs feature, the background color of lines can be changed with convenient mappings. Groups of lines can be marked in visual mode with the same mappings. There are also mappings to go to the next and previous group of marked lines.


Functionality

<Space>bu

Remove set color from current (or selected) lines.


<Space>bn

Set background of current or selected lines to green.


<Space>bg

Set background of current or selected lines to grey.


<Space>bl

Set background of current or selected lines to blue.


<Space>bp

Set background of current or selected lines to purple.


<Space>br

Set background of current or selected lines to red.


<Space>bb

Set background of current or selected lines to black.


The above mappings work in both normal and visual mode and take a count just
like built in commands.

If you have the vim-repeat plugin (https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat) installed, you can also repeat any of the above mappings with dot, '.'.


<Space>bK

Delete all lines that don't have background color set (keep only lines with
background color set).


<Space>bD

Delete all lines with background color set.


<Space>bU

Remove all set background colors.


<c-n>

Go to next group of lines with background color set.


<c-p>

Go to previous group of lines with background color set.


Options

g:wholelinecolor_leader

The key used as the leader to the mappings. The default is <Space>.

Starting sign id. The default is 373700. Change this if this is conflicting
with other sign ids, e.g. sign ids coming from other plugins.


g:wholelinecolor_next

The default is <c-n>.


g:wholelinecolor_prev
